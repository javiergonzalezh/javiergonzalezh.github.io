Just in case you want to know more about me.


<p> Before joining Amazon I was researcher associate in the <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/sitran/"> Machine Learning group </a> of the University of Sheffield. I was involved in the <a href=" http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/pa/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB/K011197/1 ">Recombinant CHO Cell Project</a> together with <a href=" http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/ ">Neil Lawrence</a> and <a href=" http://www.shef.ac.uk/chelsi/profiles/james ">David James</a>. Mi role was to design an apply new Bayesian optimization methods to scale the production of drugs using hamster cells. </p>

<p> Before coming to Sheffield, I was post-doc in the University of Groningen working with <a href=" http://www.math.rug.nl/~ernst/">Ernst Wit</a> and <a href=" http://www.rug.nl/staff/m.heinemann/index!publications ">Matthias Heinneman</a> involved in the project  “Network-based  statistical inference for replicatively aging in yeast". In this project we studied the causes of aging in yeast. My reseach there involved the develpement of new Machine Learning techniques to understand the dynamics of biological systems.</p> 


<p> I got my PhD in Mathematical Engineering at Carlos III University of Madrid under the supervision of <a href=" http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_estadistica/home/members/alberto_munoz_garcia">Alberto Muñoz</a>. In my thesis I worked on kernel methods for visulization, cluster and classification problems.</p>
