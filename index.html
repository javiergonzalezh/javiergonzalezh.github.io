    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Research Cambridge and a Visitor Researcher of the department of Mathematics and Statistics of
        Lancaster University. My research focuses on the development of probabilistic machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification and
        data-efficient sequential decision making. I work on the challenges arising when uncertainty of different types (the loss of precision
        induced by numerical calculations, data errors, model miss-calibration, etc.) need to be be propagated, controlled and reduced in
        complex pipelines. As fields of application of my research I am interested in computational biology, health, robotics and environmental
        sciences.</p>
