I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Research Cambridge and a Visitor Researcher of the department of 
Mathematics and Statistics of Lancaster University. I am interested on studing how how uncertainty can be characterized, 
quantified and used to build robust and interpretable decision systems.
