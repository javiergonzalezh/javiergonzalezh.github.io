I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Research Cambridge and a Visitor Researcher of the department of Mathematics and Statistics of Lancaster University. My research focuses on machine learning aspects of data science, mainly on the development of 'surrogate modelling' approaches for optimization and experimental design. I am interested in probabilistic modelling techniques, such as Gaussian processes, that allow to quantify uncertainly and improve the data efficiency of autonomous systems.
