<h1> Short Bio</h1>

<p> Before joining Microsoft Research I worked for three years and a half in Amazon as Machine learning scientist. I was managing a
    team that develop and deployed machine learning methods for Prime Air, Alexa and Amazon's supply chain. Before that I was researcher associate at the
    <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/sitran/"> Machine Learning group </a> of the University of Sheffield and a co-founder of Inferentia Ltd. (startup acquired by Amazon).
    I was involved in the <a href=" http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/pa/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB/K011197/1 ">Recombinant CHO
        Cell Project</a> together with <a href=" http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/ ">Neil Lawrence</a> and
    <a href=" http://www.shef.ac.uk/chelsi/profiles/james ">David James</a>. Mi role was to design an apply new Bayesian
    optimization methods to scale the production of drugs using hamster cells. </p>

<p> Before moving to Sheffield, I was post-doc in the University of Groningen working with
    <a href=" http://www.math.rug.nl/~ernst/">Ernst Wit</a> and <a href=" http://www.rug.nl/staff/m.heinemann/index!publications ">
        Matthias Heinneman</a> involved in the project  “Network-based  statistical inference for replicatively aging in yeast".
    In this project we studied the causes of aging in yeast. My reseach there involved the develpement of new Machine Learning
    techniques to understand the dynamics of biological systems.</p>

<p> I got my PhD in Mathematical Engineering at Carlos III University of Madrid under the
    supervision of <a href=" http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_estadistica/home/members/alberto_munoz_garcia">Alberto Muñoz</a>.
    In my thesis I worked on kernel methods for visulization, cluster and classification problems.</p>
